# Session Summary

## News API Enhancement (Reverted)
- GNews API addition was reverted by user request (no second API)
- News flow is back to: **Currents API** → **static fallback**
- `fetchFromCurrents` restored to original with multi-page pagination
- Static fallback preserved for both empty results and errors

## Fan Coin Page (`fancoin.html`)
- Created at root with dashboard layout (wallet, earn cards, levels, transactions)
- Uses shared top bar (logo + theme toggle + notification + profile) — no sidebar, no hamburger menu
- All styles in `css/fancoin.css`, asset paths root-relative
- `index.html` coin badge, View Wallet button, FanCoins card → all link to `fancoin.html`
- "Earn Coins" → `index.html` (predictions), "Coin History" + "View All" → expand 35 transactions inline
- Full page respects light/dark theme toggle

## Previous Work (by session context)
- Blue accent theme (#2196f3) across all pages with light/dark CSS overrides
- Auth redirect fix in `js/script.js` (guestAllowedPages)
- Tabletennis surface class overrides, removed Top Players/Upcoming Event
- Notification CSS rewrite (glassmorphism, animations, responsive)
- Theme toggle on `berforeloginindex.html` and `notification.html`
- Canvas scene backgrounds (stadium, cricket, football, basketball)
